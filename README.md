In these modern days, a lot of people communicate daily, and this has lead to the using of chat applications and chatrooms more often. Lots of developers always seem to want to implement chatrooms using different technologies such as XMPP, Socket.IO and a whole lot of other technologies. As a developer, I have built one using Socket.IO, and I thought that was fun. Here I bring to you, the gospel of Pusher. Since I started using Pusher, I have realized that dealing with Socket.IO has been a lot more stressful as they simplify the whole process.

Pusher is a library for making real-time applications and interactions.
